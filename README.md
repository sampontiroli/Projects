# master_final_project
This repository collects my submission to the final project for a Master in Data Science held by Neural Academy (Rome).
The main goal of the project was to create a model able to estimate the cost class of voyages to Tanzania, based on some training data (age and gender of tourists, country of provenance, main activities of the tour, services bought, etc...).
After performing some data analysis I ran some baseline models and decided that XGBoostClassifier was the best choice for a classifier, then I used GridSearchCV to try and improve the model, also reducing variance.
